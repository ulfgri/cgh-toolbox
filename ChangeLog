14 October 2019, version 154
- use Frenet-Serret equation to calculate normal vector
  at predicted vertices

08 October 2019, version 151
- remove 'sorted' option from cgh parameters
- implemented an algorithm for selection of phase boundary
  start intersections that works with both continuous and
  dis-continuous phase functions.

06 October 2019, version 149
- remove test scripts from the toolbox directory tree

02 October 2019, version 146
- remove the option to specify tile-specific algorithms because it
  makes no sense.

25 September 2019, version 136,137
- changed the symmetric bracket search to an asymmetric
  search that searches for isophase brackets only in one 
  direction.
- removed 'phase2ps' because it's not ready for publication
- added 'polynomials' directory with functions for Zernike
  and disk harmonic function models.

22 September 2019, version 133
- fixed serious bug in phase2cgh/pa/isophase_clip.m Now works when
  the result of clipping is more than one polygon.

20 September 2019, version 132
- moved examples into own archive and prepare for testing

15 September 2019, version 123
- 'boundary_fill' extended to work with phase functions that
   have a phase singularity (Hilbert phase term)

12 September 2019, version 120
- completed phase boundary filling algorithm that only relies
  on edge intersections.

11 September 2019, version 119
- much improved 'hi' algorithm that does away with the concept
  of 'inner boundaries'. Now a straight-forward extension of
  the 'fi' algorithm - as it should be.

04 September 2019, version 110
- 'hi' algorithm for spiral zone plates with topological charge
  (Hilbert phase term) are beginning to work. The algorithm is 
  not really satisfying yet, though.

15 Aug 2019, version 80
- both pa and fi algorithms are finally working and seem robust.

26 July 2019, version 60
- completed the vectorized form of the isoline following algorithm.

21 Jul 2019, version 51
- rewrite from scratch the original implementation of the
  pilot approximation idea by J. Soons.

14 Oct 2018, version 40
- combine all CGH functions in one place
- subdirs for different algorithms
- 'phase2cgh' parameter structure has new flag to select algorithm

07 Oct 2018, version 39
- increased the increment h vor calculation of derivatives to 1.5e-2. A
  smaller value seems to result in rounding errors and numerical instability.
- implemented heuristic for tiles containing critical points

04 Oct 2018, version 37
- basic hologram layout calculation is all working, but needs thorough testing.

03 Oct 2018
- got 'phase2cgh_tile' working.

30 Sep 2018
- reached the "proof of concept" milestone. The isophase following algorithm is
  working, even though 'isophase_fill.m' is still buggy (boy was that true ... 09/2019).

26 Sep 2018
- finished coding all parts of 'phase2cgh_tile'.
- completed debugging of 'isophase_edge_xing.m' and 'isophase_edges.m'
  as well as a bevvy of auxiliary functions.
