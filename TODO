To Do List for CGH Toolbox
--------------------------

- improve and document zernike/private/sub2pos.m
- improve edge intersection finding by calculating osculating circle - edge
  intersections instead of segment - edge intersections
- move common section of '*_vertex_init.m' functions into a separate function
- 'openblas_threads' should be able to set the number of threads. What if
  the octave installation does not use OpenBLAS ?
- ensure that the 'hi' algorithm works with more than one singularity
- update all Contents.m files
- 'boundary_vertex_init' fails to find all curves that terminate on the
  singularity. Is there a way to find all initial vertices at once ?
- use intersection of a straight line with a circle to look up tile
  edge intersections instead of a straight line (is no showstopper)
- code to follow phase discontinuity (needed for 'wp')
- code to find termination point of discontinuity at an edge (needed for 'wp')
- algorithm for wrapped phase functions (multiplexed CGHs)
- handle the case that the tangent vector at the start of an isophase
  points exactly in the direction of the edge (may be OK already ?)
- an implementation of Forbes-polynomials for phase function models
- boundary_vertex_init: calculate phase intersections through small semi-circle
  around singularity --> degeneracy of isophase curves at singularity is removed.
- boundary_fill': remove degeneracy in singularity locations along the edge by
  finding intersections of curves terminating at the singularity and a small
  semi-circle around the singularity. Then call 'isophase_fill'.


Done List
---------

- wrap the calls to phase2cgh_tile_* into try-catch blocks and print some
  helpful information in case of a crash (DONE, 166)
- 'orient_polygon' function to reduce code duplication (DONE)
- remove recursive calls to '*_curves' because thy should no
  longer be needed. (DONE)
- remove the 'sorted' option and always sort edge intersections, because
  sorted edge intersections are required for the filling algorithm to work (DONE)
- find a way to pick start edge intersections such that there is no duplicate
  tracing of boundary curves even when their phase is not constant (DONE)
- include 'minterp2', which is needed for 'phase_map' (DONE)
- what is a "sine-modulated toroidal lens" ? (DONE: phase function removed)
- limit recursion depth (number of isoline segments) in 'isophase_fill'
  Runaway recursion generally points to a problem with the isophase curves. (DONE)
- improve 'hi' algorithm; eliminate concept of 'internal edges' (DONE)
- calculate the normal vectors at predicted vertices and use
  them for the bracketing directions. (DONE)
- isophase filling algorithm that relies solely on edge topology (DONE)
- 'hi' algorithm for phase functions with discontinuous Hilbert terms (DONE)
- code to find termination point of isoline at a discontinuity (DONE)
- more debugging is needed for 'pa' and 'fi' methods with layout that has
  larger isoline curvatures (DONE)
- properly vectorize the inner loop in /pa/isophase_refine.m (DONE)
- prune unneeded polygon vertices in pa/isophase_refine.m (DONE sufficently well)
- vectorize the isophase following algorithm (DONE; it's now faster
  than the pilot approximation algorithm, down from one order of magnitude
  slower for the non-vectorized implementation)
- functions for derivatives, isoline curvature of discontinuous phase (DONE & tested)
- figure out why 'vfmatch' crashes in 'isophase_edge_xing' (DONE)
- rewrite J. Soon's code from scratch (DONE)
- debug 'isophase_fill.m' (DONE)
- correctly handle tiles without any edge intersections. Tiles without
  intersections can be either opaque or clear (DONE).
