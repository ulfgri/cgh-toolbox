June 24, 2015; Ulf Griesmann
- version 35
- some code cleanup and scripts for easier building

September 1, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 34
- begin to make it 64-bit safe for MATLAB by using the 
  new mwSize and mwIndex types. 

August 23, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 33
- fixed a couple of bugs in domain checks (J. Soons, NIST).
- removed C++ style comments from minterp2.gperf because some
  C compilers don't accept them.

August 20, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 32
- corrected an error in the help text in 'minterp2.m'.
  The explanation of x and y was reversed. 

May 1, 2014; Ulf Griesmann
- version 31
- try to avoid segmentation violations by accessing data
  outside the interpolated matrix (interpolation too 
  close to the data map edge).

September 10, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 30
- only small fixes here and there.
- new interpolation option 'spline', which is a synonym
  for 'pchip'. 

September 9, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 29
- minor cleanups; no significant improvements seem possible ...

September 8, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 27,28
- only re-calculate coefficients for bilinear and bicubic
  interpolation when X0 or y0 change.
- speed improvement in Lagrange interpolation.

September 7, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 26
- finally found the bug in cubic interpolation. 

August 25, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 25
- replaced most of the divisions in interp_lagrange with
  multiplications. Much faster.

August 24, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 23
- added 3rd order Lagrange interpolation. Better than linear
  interpolation, but derivatives are not continuous.
- cubic interpolation still seems to have a bug ...

August 12, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 22
- 'snprintf' does not exist in Visual Studio; use 'sprintf' instead.
- rename include file with hash function --> minterp2.h

August 10, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 21
- use hash function for the interpolation
  function selection. Not really important but
  more elegant.
- small fixes.

July 23, 2013; Ulf Griesmann
- version 20
- renamed minterp2mex.c --> minterp2.c and moved the argument
  checking code into the mex function.
- use __inline__ and __restrict compiler hints to get better code
  from GCC on machines with AVX. 

January 22, 2012; Ulf Griesmann
- version 18
- minor change in minterp2mex.c to improve
  readability of code.

January 21, 2012; Ulf Griesmann
- version 17
- interpolation functions return NaN instead of invalid
  data when interpolation point is too close to the 'edge' 
  of the matrix.
  
November 6, 2011; Ulf Griesmann
- version 16
- some reformatting to make code more readable. 

November 5, 2011; Ulf Griesmann
- version 15
- made 'pchip' method a bit faster by saving a few multiplications.

November 5, 2011; Ulf Griesmann
- version 14
- added piecewise Hermite spline interpolation. This is now the default
  method.
